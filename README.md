# 🚗 Car Price Predictor - ML Web App

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the estimated price of a car based on user inputs such as brand, model year, fuel type, transmission, and mileage. Built using **Readdy AI**, this no-code web app offers a fast and intuitive way to estimate car resale prices using a regression model trained on real-world automotive data.

> ✅ Created as part of InternPe ML Project Task.
